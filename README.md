## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Animations
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Another simple project to practice some other skills other than layout. I've been putting a lot of work towards practicing animations. And this project was not an exception. I could finish the project with the bonus challenge and build it with HTML and CSS. However, I really wanted to make it more interactive. Every developer knows that when you want to make something interactive, JS is the ultimate tool for that. And adding these animations might have been possible with the checkbox hack, but I wanted something more professional.
